# Magenta RT: Streaming music generation!

Magenta RealTime is a Python library for streaming music audio generation on
your local device. It is the open source / on device companion to
[MusicFX DJ Mode](https://labs.google/fx/tools/music-fx-dj) and the
[Lyria RealTime API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/music-generation).

This is a ðŸ‘€ sneak preview of the Magenta RT project. We will have
[more to share](#coming-soon) in the coming weeks including a technical report
and additional features!

See our [blog post](https://g.co/magenta/rt) and
[model card](https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime/blob/main/MODEL.md) for
more info.

## Getting started

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/magenta-realtime/blob/main/notebooks/Magenta_RT_Demo.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open Notebook In Colab"/>
</a>

The fastest way to get started with Magenta RT is to try our official
[Colab Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/magenta/magenta-realtime/blob/main/notebooks/Magenta_RT_Demo.ipynb)
which runs in real time on freely available TPUs! Here is a quick
[video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVTuEdeepVs).

If you have a machine with a TPU or GPU, you may also following the installation
instructions below for running locally.

## Local installation

Install the latest version:

```sh
# With GPU support:
pip install 'git+https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime#egg=magenta_rt[gpu]'
# With TPU support:
pip install 'git+https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime#egg=magenta_rt[tpu]'
# CPU only
pip install 'git+https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime'
```

Or, clone and install for local editing:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/magenta/magenta-realtime.git && cd magenta-realtime
pip install -e .[gpu]
```

## Examples

### Generating audio with Magenta RT

Magenta RT generates audio in short chunks (2s) given a finite amount of past
context (10s). We use crossfading to mitigate boundary artifacts between chunks.
More details on our model are coming soon in a technical report!

```py
from magenta_rt import audio, system
from IPython.display import display, Audio

num_seconds = 10
mrt = system.MagentaRT()
style = system.embed_style('funk')

chunks = []
state = None
for i in range(round(num_seconds / mrt.config.chunk_length)):
  state, chunk = mrt.generate_chunk(state=state, style=style)
  chunks.append(chunk)
generated = audio.concatenate(crossfade_time=mrt.crossfade_length)
display(Audio(generated.samples.swapaxes(0, 1), rate=mrt.sample_rate))
```

### Blending text and audio styles with MusicCoCa

MusicCoCa is a joint embedding model of text and audio styles. Magenta RT is
conditioned on MusicCoCa embeddings allowing for seamless blending of styles
using any number of text and audio prompts.

```py
from magenta_rt import audio, musiccoca

style_model = musiccoca.MusicCoCa()
my_audio = audio.Waveform.from_file('myjam.mp3')
weighted_styles = [
  (2.0, my_audio),
  (1.0, 'heavy metal'),
]
weights = np.array([w for w, _ in weighted_styles])
styles = style_model.embed([s for _, s in weighted_styles])
weights_norm = weights / weights.sum()
blended = (weights_norm[:, np.newaxis] * styles).mean(axis=0)
```

### Tokenizing audio with SpectroStream

SpectroStream is a discrete audio codec model operating on high-fidelity music
audio (stereo, 48kHz). Under the hood, Magenta RT models SpectroStream audio
tokens using a language model.

```py
from magenta_rt import audio, spectrostream

codec = spectrostream.SpectroStream()
my_audio = audio.Waveform.from_file('jam.mp3')
my_tokens = codec.encode(my_audio)
my_audio_reconstruction = codec.decode(tokens)
```

## Running tests

Unit tests:

```sh
pip install -e .[test]
pytest .
```

Integration tests:

```sh
python test/musiccoca_end2end_test.py
python test/spectrostream_end2end_test.py
python test/magenta_rt_end2end_test.py
```

## Coming soon!

The following is a list of features we have planned for the near future (subject
to change). Please open an issue if there are features you would like to see, or
open a pull request if you would like to contribute!

-   Technical report
-   Colab for fine tuning
-   Colab for conditioning on real-time audio input
